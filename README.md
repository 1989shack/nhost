[Nhost](https://nhost.io) is the open source Firebase alternative with GraphQL.

> NEWS: Support for Flutter and Dart is now available ([blog post](https://nhost.io/blog/beta-support-for-dart-and-flutter-on-nhost)).

Nhost is a backend as a service (BaaS) that provides the generic building block every modern app need: Database, GraphQL API, Authentication, Storage, Serverless Functions.

Simply, Nhost is the fastest and easiest way to build modern web and mobile apps that scale.
