With Nhost, you can deploy Serverless Functions to execute custom code. Each serverless function is its HTTP endpoint.

Serverless functions can be used to handle [event triggers](/platform/database/event-triggers), form submission, integrations (e.g. Stripe, Slack, etc), and more.

## Creating a serverless function

Every `.js` (JavaScript) and `.ts` (TypeScript) file in the `functions/` folder of your Nhost app is its own serverless function.

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript" default>

```ts title=functions/test.ts
import { Request, Response } from 'express'

export default (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.status(200).send(`Hello ${req.query.name}!`)
}
```

:::info

You **MUST** install `express` locally in the base directory of your Nhost app.

```bash
npm install -d express @types/express
# or yarn
yarn add -d express @types/express
```

:::

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js title=functions/test.js
export default (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).send(`Hello ${req.query.name}!`)
}
```

:::info

You **MUST** install `express` locally in the base directory of your Nhost app.

```bash
npm install -d express
# or yarn
yarn add -d express
```

:::

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Routing

HTTP endpoints are automatically generated based on the file structure inside `functions/`.

Here's an example of four serverless functions with their files and their HTTP endpoints:

| File                        | HTTP Endpoint                                                 |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `functions/index.js`        | `https://[app-subdomain].nhost.run/v1/functions/`             |
| `functions/users/index.ts`  | `https://[app-subdomain].nhost.run/v1/functions/users`        |
| `functions/users/active.ts` | `https://[app-subdomain].nhost.run/v1/functions/users/active` |
| `functions/my-copmany.js`   | `https://[app-subdomain].nhost.run/v1/functions/my-company`   |

## Environment Variables

[Environment variables](/platform/environment-variables) are available inside your serverless functions. Both in production and when running Nhost locally using the [Nhost CLI](/platform/cli).

## Billing

Serverless functions are billed per GB-sec or GB-hour. 1 GB-hour is 3600 GB-seconds.

1 GB-sec is 1 function with 1 GB of RAM running for 1 second. If 1 function with 1 GB of RAM runs for 3600 seconds, that's the equivalent of 1 GB-hour.

All serverless functions in production are running with 128 MB of RAM. It's not currently possible to change this.

## Node Version

All serverless functions in production are running Node.js version 14.x. It's not currently possible to change this.

## Regions

Serverless Functions are always deployed to the same region as your app.
