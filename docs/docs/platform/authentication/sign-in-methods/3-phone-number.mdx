Follow this guide to sign in users with a phone number (SMS).

## Sign In

2. The user uses the OTP to sign in

```js
// Step 1: Send OTP to the user's phone number
await nhost.auth.signIn({
  phoneNumber: '0011233213123'
})

// Step 2: Sign in user using their phone number and OTP
await nhost.auth.signIn({
  phoneNumber: '0011233213123'
  otp: '123456',
})
```
