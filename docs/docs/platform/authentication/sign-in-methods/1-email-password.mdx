Follow this guide to sign in users with email and password.

The email and password sign-in method is enabled by default for all Nhost apps.

Users must first **sign up** with email and password to be able to sign in.

Use the [Nhost JavaScript client](/reference/javascript) to sign up users in your app:

```js
nhost.auth.signUp({
  email: 'joe@example.com',
  password: 'secret-password'
})
```

## Sign In Users

Use the [Nhost JavaScript client](/reference/javascript) to sign in users in your app:

```js
nhost.auth.signIn({
  email: 'joe@example.com',
  password: 'secret-password'
})
```

## Verified Emails

You can decide if only verified emails should be able to sign in or not. Modify the **Only allow login for verified emails.** setting in the **Login Settings** section under **Users** in your Nhost app.

An email-verification email is automatically sent to the user during sign-up if your app only allows to sign in users with verified emails. You can also manually send the verification email to the user using [`nhost.auth.sendVerificationEmail()`](/reference/javascript/auth/send-verification-email).
