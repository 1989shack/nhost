Follow this guide to sign in users with Magic Link, also called passwordless email.

The Magic Link sign-in method enables you to sign in users to your app using an email address, without requiring a password.

To sign in users with Magic Link is a two-step process:

1. Send a Magic Link to the user's email address.
2. The user clicks the Magic Link in their email to sign in to your app.

Use the [Nhost JavaScript client](/reference/javascript) to sign up users with Magic Link in your app:

  email: 'joe@example.com'
})
```
