Follow this guide to sign in users with Magic Link.

The Magic Link sign-in method enables you to sign in users to your app using an email address, without requiring a password.

An email is sent to the user with a link (Magic Link). When the user clicks the link the user is automatically signed in to your app.

Use the [Nhost JavaScript client](/reference/javascript) to sign up users with Magic Link in your app:

```js
nhost.auth.signIn({
  email: 'joe@example.com'
})
```
