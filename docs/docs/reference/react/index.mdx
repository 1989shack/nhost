The Nhost React client exports a React provider, hooks, and helpers that make it easier to work with Nhost in your React app. If you're using React with Next.js, you should use the [Nhost Next.js client](/reference/nextjs).

## Installation

Install the Nhost React client together with GraphQL:

<Tabs groupId="package-manager">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>

```bash
npm install @nhost/react graphql
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">

```bash
yarn add @nhost/react graphql
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Initializing

Initialize a single `nhost` instance and wrap your app with the `NhostReactProvider`.

```jsx title=src/App.tsx
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

import { NhostClient, NhostReactProvider } from '@nhost/react'

import App from './App'

const nhost = new NhostClient({
  backendUrl: '<Your Nhost Backend URL>'
})

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <NhostReactProvider nhost={nhost}>
      <App />
    </NhostReactProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

:::info

The `nhost` instance created with the `NhostClient` above is the same as the [JavaScript Nhost client](/reference/javascript).
