# `useAuthenticationStatus()`

The Nhost client may need some initial steps to determine the authentication status during startup, like fetching a new JWT from an existing refresh token.

**`@returns`**

`isLoading` will return `true` until the authentication status is known.

` isAuthenticated` returns `true` if the user is authenticated, `false` if not or if the client is still determining the status.
