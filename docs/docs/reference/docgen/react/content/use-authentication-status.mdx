# `useAuthenticationStatus()`

The Nhost client may need some initial steps to determine the authentication status during startup, like fetching a new JWT from an existing refresh token.

**`@returns`**

`isLoading` will return `true` until the authentication status is known.

` isAuthenticated` returns `true` if the user is authenticated, `false` if not or if the client is still determining the status.

```jsx
import { useAuthenticationStatus } from '@nhost/react'

const Component = () => {
  const { isLoading, isAuthenticated } = useAuthenticationStatus()
  if (isLoading) {
    return <div>Loading Nhost authentication status...</div>
  }

  if (isAuthenticated) {
    return <div>User is authenticated</div>
  }

  return <div>Public section</div>
}
```
