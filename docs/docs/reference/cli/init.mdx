Intialize a local Nhost app in the current working directory.

```
nhost init
```

If you already have a Nhost app in Nhost Cloud you can use that app as a starting point by appending `--remote` to the command.

This will pull the database migrations and Hasura metadata from the Nhost Cloud app locally for you to use as a starting point.

```
nhost init --remote
```
