Hasura Auth handles **authentication** for [Hasura](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine).

It runs in a separate Docker container along side Postgres and Hasura.

## Features

- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Users are stored in Postgres and accessed via GraphQL
- 🔑 Multiple sign-in methods
- ✨ Integrates with GraphQL and Hasura Permissions
- 🔐 JWT tokens and Refresh Tokens.
- ✉️ Emails sent on various operations
<!-- - ✅ Optional checking for Pwned Passwords. -->
- Two-factor authentication support.
- 👨‍💻 Written 100% in TypeScript.

### Authentication methods

- **Email and Password** - simple email and password method.
- **Email** - also called **passwordless email** or **magic link**.
- **SMS** - also called **passwordless sms**.
- **Anonymous** - sign in users without any method. Anonymous users can be
  converted to _regular_ users at a later stage.
- **OAuth providers**:

  - Facebook
  - Google
  - GitHub
  - Twitter
  - Apple
  - LinkedIn
  - Windows Live
  - Spotify
  - Strave
  - GitLab
  - BitBucket

## Integration with Hasura

Hasura Auth's final purpose is to securely provide a JSON Web Token that can be added as an authorization header to GraphQL operation sent to Hasura.
Hasura auth automatically generates and manages two kinds of tokens:

- An access token (JWT), that will be used to authenticate the GraphQL operations in Hasura, and that has a limited expiration limit (15 minutes by default)
- A refresh token, that is used to ask Hasura Auth for a new access token, and that can be consummed only once.

Access tokens generated by Hasura Auth contains information and user id, its default role, and the roles they actually have. In addition, it is possible since version `0.2.0` to extend JWT claims with custom information such as organisation or project ownership, so your application can leverage the capabilities of the [Hasura permissions layer](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/auth/authorization/index.html).

<!-- - Users and accounts are saved in the database. -->

You can read further information about JWT and Hasura in the [official Hasura documentation](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/auth/authentication/jwt.html).
