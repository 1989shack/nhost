Hasura Auth runs in a container alongside Postgres and Hasura.

## Nhost (recommended)

The recommended way to start using Hasura Auth is by using Nhost. With Nhost, you will get a complete backend ready in seconds with Hasura, authentication, storage and serverless functions.

Go to [Nhost](https://nhost.io) and start building your app now.

## Docker-compose

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nhost/hasura-auth.git
cd hasura-auth
cp .env.example .env
docker-compose -f docker-compose-example.yaml up
```

Hasura Auth comes with plenty of options. They are explained in the [configuration section](/reference/hasura-auth/configuration).

If you are already familiar with the application, you can also have a look at the [environment variables](/reference/hasura-auth/environment-variables) that can be passed on to your docker container.
