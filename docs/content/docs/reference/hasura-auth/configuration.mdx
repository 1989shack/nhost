## Email configuration

It is possible to enable the following features in configuring an external SMTP email service:

- Sign up
- Password reset
- Email change
- Passwordless with emails

### SMTP settings

### Email templates

#### With Docker

<!-- Explain how to mount a folder -->

#### Remote email templates

When running Hasura Auth in its own infrastructure, it is possible to mount a volume with custom `email-templates` directory. However, in some cases, we may want to fetch templates from an external HTTP endpoint. Hence the introduction of a new `AUTH_EMAIL_TEMPLATE_FETCH_URL` environment variable:

```bash
AUTH_EMAIL_TEMPLATE_FETCH_URL=https://github.com/nhost/nhost/tree/custom-email-templates-example/examples/custom-email-templates
```

In the above example, on every email creation, the server will use this URL to fetch its templates, depending on the locale, email type and field.

For instance, the template for english verification email body will the fetched in [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhost/nhost/main/examples/custom-email-templates/en/email-verify/body.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhost/nhost/main/examples/custom-email-templates/en/email-verify/body.html).

See the [example in the main nhost/nhost repository](https://github.com/nhost/nhost/tree/main/examples/custom-email-templates).

The context variables in email templates have been simplified: the `${link}` variable contains the entire redirection url the recipient needs to follow.

## Email + password Sign Up

### Email checks

You can specify a list of allowed emails or domains with `AUTH_ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOWED_EMAILS` and `AUTH_ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS`.

As an example, the following environment variables will only allow `@nhost.io`, `@example.com` and `bob@smith.com` to register to the application:

```
AUTH_ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOWED_EMAILS=bob@smith.com
AUTH_ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS=nhost.io,example.com
```

In the above example, users with the following emails would be able to register `bob@smith.com`, `emma@example.com`, `john@nhost.io`, whereas `mary@firebase.com` won't.

Similarly, it is possible to provide a list of forbidden emails or domains with `AUTH_ACCESS_CONTROL_BLOCKED_EMAILS` and `AUTH_ACCESS_CONTROL_BLOCKED_EMAIL_DOMAINS`.

### Password checks

Hasura auth does not accepts passwords with less than three characters. This limit can be changed in changing the `AUTH_PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH` environment variable.

It is also possible to only allow [passwords that have not been pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) in setting `AUTH_PASSWORD_HIBP_ENABLED` to `true`.

---

## Multi-factor authentication

Hasura Auth supports multiple types of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

### Passwordless with emails

Hasura Auth supports email [passwordless authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passwordless_authentication). It requires [SMTP](#email-configuration) to be configured properly.

To enable it, you also need to set `AUTH_EMAIL_PASSWORDLESS_ENABLED` to `true`.

### Passwordless with SMS

### Time-based one-time password (TOTP)

---

## OAuth authentication

---

## Gravatar

Hasura Auth stores the avatar URL of users in a specific field. By default, it will look for the Gravatar linked to the email, and store it into this field.
It is possible to deactivate the use of Gravatar in setting the `AUTH_GRAVATAR_ENABLED` environment variable to `false`.

---

## Extending user schema

Adding columns to the user tables may be tempting. However, all the tables and columns have a specific purpose, and changing the structure of the `auth` schema will very likely end in breaking the functionning of Hasura Auth.

There are two recommended ways of extending user information:

- to store information in the `auth.users.metadata` column
- to store information in a separate table located in the `public` PostgreSQL schema, and to point to `auth.users.id` through a foreign key.

### `metadata` user field

A basic JSONB `metadata` column in the `auth.users` table, that is passed on as an option on registration:

```json
{
  "email": "bob@bob.com",
  "passord": "12345678",
  "options": {
    "metadata": {
      "first_name": "Bob"
    }
  }
}
```

<!-- TODO hooks on the metadata field -->

### Additional user information in the `public` schema

## Custom Hasura JWT claims

Hasura comes with a [powerful authorisation system](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/auth/authorization/index.html). Hasura Auth is already configured to add `x-hasura-user-id`, `x-hasura-allowed-roles`, and `x-hasura-user-isAnonymous` to the JSON Web Tokens it generates.

This release introduces the ability to define custom claims to add to the JWT, so they can be used by Hasura to determine the permissions of the received GraphQL operation.

Each custom claim is defined by a pair of a key and a value:

- The key determines the name of the claim, prefixed by `x-hasura`. For instance, `organisation-id`will become `x-hasura-organisation-id`.
- The value is a representation of the path to look at to determine the value of the claim. For instance `profile.organisation.id` will look for the `user.profile` Hasura relationship, and the `profile.organisation` Hasura relationship. Array values are transformed into Postgres syntax so Hasura can interpret them. See the official Hasura documentation to understand the [session variables format](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/auth/authorization/roles-variables.html#format-of-session-variables).

```bash
AUTH_JWT_CUSTOM_CLAIMS={"organisation-id":"profile.organisation.id", "project-ids":"profile.contributesTo.project.id"}
```

Will automatically generate and fetch the following GraphQL query:

```graphql
{
  user(id: "<user-id>") {
    profile {
      organisation {
        id
      }
      contributesTo {
        project {
          id
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

It will then use the same expressions e.g. `profile.contributesTo.project.id` to evaluate the result with [JSONata](https://jsonata.org/), and possibly transform arrays into Hasura-readable, PostgreSQL arrays.Finally, it adds the custom claims to the JWT in the `https://hasura.io/jwt/claims` namespace:

```json
{
  "https://hasura.io/jwt/claims": {
    "x-hasura-organisation-id": "8bdc4f57-7d64-4146-a663-6bcb05ea2ac1",
    "x-hasura-project-ids": "{\"3af1b33f-fd0f-425e-92e2-0db09c8b2e29\",\"979cb94c-d873-4d5b-8ee0-74527428f58f\"}",
    "x-hasura-allowed-roles": [ "me", "user" ],
    "x-hasura-default-role": "user",
    "x-hasura-user-id": "121bbea4-908e-4540-ac5d-52c7f6f93bec",
    "x-hasura-user-isAnonymous": "false"
  }
  "sub": "f8776768-4bbd-46f8-bae1-3c40da4a89ff",
  "iss": "hasura-auth",
  "iat": 1643040189,
  "exp": 1643041089
}
```
