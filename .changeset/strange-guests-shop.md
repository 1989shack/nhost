use the [same methods and typings](https://github.com/nhost/nhost/tree/feat/vue/packages/core/src/promises) to interact with xstate machines in both `@nhost/hasura-auth-js`, `@nhost/react` hooks and `@nhost/vue` composables
Both `@nhost/react`, `@nhost/hasura-auth-js` and `@nhost/vue` interact with the authentication state in a similar way. As a result, the same code was repeated three times, with risks of insonsistency and difficult maintainability. `@nhost/core` now contains the logic and Typescript interfaces that are used in the Vanilla client, React hooks and Vue composables.
